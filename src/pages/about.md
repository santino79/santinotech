#About Alan Hylands

## Who I am.

My name is **Alan Hylands** and I am a **data consultant** and **freelance writer** from Northern Ireland.

##What I've done.

I've worked in **tech, data and analytics** for nearly 20 years - building, reporting, analysing, managing and mentoring.

##I have:

* Helped nurses provide better care for their patients by more accurately recording and reporting their treatments.
* Allowed small local businesses to successfully sell their goods to all four corners of the globe from the comfort of their own homes.
* Kept the savings of hundreds of thousands of ordinary people safe when the dark clouds of the financial crash loomed over us all.
* Built Customer Lifetime Value models to segment customer bases and get to know the best customers better.
* And much, much more (that I'm not allowed to tell about. _Good old corporate NDAs._)

##A little more background.

I studied **Accounting** at university and planned for a future in finance.

Then I found the **internet, programming and databases**.

I started my first **e-commerce** development agency in 2003. Since then I have worked on a number of small business start-ups in e-commerce, analytics, marketing, online research and content marketing.

[I started a successful football website](https://alanhylands.com/i-want-to-be-a-football-writer-when-i-grow-up/) which gave me the opportunity to write professionally for the **New York Times Company**.

Quite unexpectedly, I was seduced into the corporate world of **banking and financial services** in the boom-time mid-noughties.

I spent over twelve years running **Data and Analytics projects** for a large UK and Ireland banking group. I worked my way up through the ranks from senior data analyst to senior analytics manager to **Head of Retail Commercial Excellence**.

We operated as a small, highly skilled mini-consultancy, helping guide the business on getting most value out of their commercial data driven projects and programmes.

Now in my own consulting work at [Santinotech](https://santinotech.com), I bring all of my **financial, analytical and entrepreneurial experience** to the table to get results for our customers.

I am also **Technical Director** at [Cura Fitness](https://curafitness.com), a boutique fitness studio based in County Down, Northern Ireland. We offer group fitness classes and personal training to ladies of all ages, shapes, sizes and fitness levels. I run the back office operations including finances, data, technology and administration.

##Where you can find me.

I live in the same small town I grew up in with my beautiful and very talented wife and our two equally beautiful and talented daughters.
