            <h2 className="home__section__header">Our Purpose.</h2>
            
              <h3>The Problem.</h3> 
              The robots are coming to take our jobs. 
              Algorithms will replace all humans rendering us worthless in the workplace. 
              And your data is being collected, snooped on and sold to whoever pays the highest price <strong>EVERYWHERE</strong> you go.
              <br /><br />
              Sounds pretty grim, doesn't it?
              <h3>It doesn't have to be that way.</h3> 
              We support businesses and organisations moving towards a more digital, data-driven future. 
              That doesn't mean getting rid of all of their human workers and handing the keys over to the machines.
              <br /><br />
              It's about melding the business knowledge and experience of your people with the right tools, systems and technology 
              to make real differences to your customers lives.
              <br /><br />
              Business isn't a battle of "us" vs. "them" where it's all about fleecing the customer for as much as we can 
              and doing a runner with the loot. That's a zero sum game. There are no winners there, only losers.
              <h3>Our Mission.</h3>
              Our mission is to help promote <strong>data literacy</strong> and the <strong>ethical use of data and technology</strong> across the world. 
              And help build some damn fine businesses we can be proud to be associated with while we are doing that.
              <br /><br />
              That means improving how we capture, collate, transform and use data to build better data-driven businesses. 
              Ones where our customers don't have to worry that we are spying on them or selling their personal data. 
              Places where technology improves their customer experience, not destroys it.
              <br /><br />
              We help transform businesses and deliver results - the right way. Simple as that.
