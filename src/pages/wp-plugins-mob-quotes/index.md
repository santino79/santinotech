![Mob Quotes Wordpress Plugin](./mob-quotes.png)

**Mob Quotes** is a simple Wordpress plugin based on the most famous of all Wordpress plugins, Hello Dolly by [Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt).

While Hello Dolly symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of a whole generation, Mob Quotes takes your Wordpress admin panel down a somewhat darker path. Louis Armstrong couldn't be further away from the collection of random quotes from top Mafia gangsters that will appear in your admin panel.

Mob Quotes was built as a first step into the ever welcoming world of Wordpress plugin development. Gone are Hello Dolly's lyrics and in there place are a large selection of quips, quotes and sayings from some of the most feared mobsters in American organized crime history. From "Dapper Don" John Gotti to "Prime Minister of the Underworld" Frank Costello, there should be a quote to inspire (or chill the blood) of all aspiring Wordpress bloggers and developers.

After you install the plugin, you'll find a quote at the top of each page on your admin panel and after each page refresh. They won't be on the public facing pages or posts of your Wordpress website though.
